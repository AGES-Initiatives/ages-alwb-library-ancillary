{'id_' : 'le|pr|tr|d062_en_UK_notes|lash|lemcVE|reading2|text', 'text' : '[note] Do not be a drinker, nor stretch yourself in subscriptions to parties, and purchases of meats: The Hebrew is quite different. The Greek translator appears to have underlined the financial aspect of the dangers of eating and drinking with others. Polonius would have agreed. [note] Buy truth, and do not sell wisdom, instruction, and understanding: This verse, 23, is not in the original Septuagint, but it is found in the Triodion. The Greek is a possible translation of the Hebrew, but most versions translate the latter with something like: ’Buy truth, and do not sell <it; buy> wisdom, instruction, and understanding’ [NRSV]. The bracketed words in italics are not in the Hebrew, and the Greek is a literal version of the Hebrew. Some scholars consider the verse to be a secondary addition to the Hebrew. [note] For a foreign house is a perforated wine-jar; and something foreign is a narrow well: The Greek here is very odd. The Hebrew refers to the dangers of prostitutes for a young man. ’Foreignness’ is linked in the Old Testament to idolatry, which is often seen as adultery and ’foreign’ women as a danger since the time of Solomon. [note] For such a one will perish suddenly; and every transgressor will be destroyed: This verse bears virtually no relation to the Hebrew, which continues the theme of the dangers of the prostitute. [note] Do not get drunk with wine; but talk with just men, and converse in discussions: The Greek word peripatos means a place for walking, particularly a covered walk, but also a ’discussion’ such as one might take part while walking in such a place. It also refers to the well known school of philosophy. The Hebrew again is quite different.'}
