lemcTE.reading1.text="[note] blood of Jerusalem: The word ‘Jerusalem’ is not in the LXX, but it was added by Origen, from the Hebrew and so is included in the text of the Triodion. [note] The translator has got into difficulties by reading  ‘and he will create’ as ‘and he will come’. [note] In fact both Greek and Hebrew have ‘horn’, but the Hebrew, on the basis of Arabic parallels, is understood to mean ‘an isolated hill’. Whether the LXX translator knew this is another question! If the experts are right this is the only example of this meaning of the word in Hebrew. [note] And I made a hedge: In view of the next verses, where the owner speaks in the first person, the LXX’s change of person here is not so illogical. [note] And now inhabitants of Jerusalem, and people of Juda: Hebrew has the singular in both phrases."
